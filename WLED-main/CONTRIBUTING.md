# Thank you for making WLED better!

WLED is a community-driven project, and every contribution matters! We appreciate your time and effort.

Our maintainers are here for two things: **helping you** improve your code, and **keeping WLED** lean, efficient, and maintainable. 
We'll work with you to refine your contribution, but we'll also push back if something might create technical debt or add features without clear value. Don't take it personally - we're just protecting WLED's architecture while helping your contribution succeed!

## Getting Started

Here are a few suggestions to make it easier for you to contribute:

### Important Developer Infos
* [Project Structure, Files and Directories](AGENTS.md#project-structure) (in our AI instructions)
* [Instructions for creating usermods](AGENTS.md#usermod-pattern) (in our AI instructions)
* KB: [Compiling WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/advanced/compiling-wled/) - slightly outdated but still helpful :-)
* Arduino IDE is not supported any more. Use VSCode with the PlatformIO extension. 
* [Compiling in VSCode/Platformio](https://github.com/wled/WLED-Docs/issues/161) - modern way without command line or platformio.ini changes.
* If you add a new feature, consider making a PR to [``wled-docs``](https://github.com/wled/WLED-Docs) for updating our official documentation.

### PR from a branch in your own fork
Start your pull request (PR) in a branch of your own fork. Don't make a PR directly from your main branch.
This lets you update your PR if needed, while you can work on other tasks in 'main' or in other branches.

> [!TIP]
>   **The easiest way to start your first PR**
>   When viewing a file in `wled/WLED`, click on the "pen" icon and start making changes.
>   When you choose to 'Commit changes', GitHub will automatically create a PR from your fork.

### Target branch for pull requests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make all PRs against the `main` branch.

### Describing your PR

Please add a description of your proposed code changes. 
A PR with no description or just a few words might not get accepted, simply because very basic information is missing.
No need to write an essay!

A good description helps us to review and understand your proposed changes. For example, you could say a few words about
* What you try to achieve (new feature, fixing a bug, refactoring, security enhancements, etc.)
* How your code works (short technical summary - focus on important aspects that might not be obvious when reading the code)
* Testing you performed, known limitations, anything you couldn't quite solve.
* Let us know if you'd like guidance from a maintainer (WLED is a big project 😉)

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting:

- ✅ Does it compile?
- ✅ Does your feature/fix actually work?
- ✅ Did you break anything else?
- ✅ Tested on actual hardware if possible?

Mention your testing in the PR description (e.g., "Tested on ESP32 + WS2812B").

## During Review

We're all volunteers, so reviews can take some time (longer during busy times). 
Don't worry - we haven't forgotten you! Feel free to ping after a week if there's no activity.

### Updating your code
While the PR is open, you can keep updating your branch - just push more commits! GitHub will automatically update your PR. 

You don't need to squash commits or clean up history - we'll handle that when merging.

> [!CAUTION] 
> Do not use "force-push" while your PR is open!
> It has many subtle and unexpected consequences on our GitHub repository.
> For example, we regularly lose review comments when the PR author force-pushes code changes. Our review bot (coderabbit) may become unable to properly track changes, it gets confused or stops responding to questions.
> So, pretty please, do not force-push.

> [!TIP]
> Use [cherry-picking](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/managing-commits/cherry-picking-a-commit-in-github-desktop) to copy commits from one branch to another.


### Responding to Reviews

When we ask for changes:

- **Add new commits** - please don't amend or force-push
- **Reply in the PR** - let us know when you've addressed comments
- **Ask questions** - if something's unclear, just ask!
- **Be patient** - we're all volunteers here 😊

You can reference feedback in commit messages:
> ```text
> Fix naming per @Aircoookie's suggestion
> ```

### Dealing with Merge Conflicts

Got conflicts with `main`? No worries - here's how to fix them:

**Using GitHub Desktop** (easier for beginners):

1. Click **Fetch origin**, then **Pull origin**
2. If conflicts exist, GitHub Desktop will warn you - click **View conflicts**
3. Open the conflicted files in your editor (VS Code, etc.)
4. Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and keep the correct code
5. Save the files
6. Back in GitHub Desktop, commit the merge (it'll suggest a message)
7. Click **Push origin**

**Using command line**:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/main
   # Fix conflicts in your editor
   git add .
   git commit
   git push
   ```

Either way works fine - pick what you're comfortable with! Merging is simpler than rebasing and keeps everything connected.

#### When you MUST rebase (really rare!)

Sometimes you might hit merge conflicts with `main` that are harder to solve. Here's what to try:

1. **Merge instead of rebase** (safest option):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/main
   git push
   ```
   Keeps review comments attached and CI results visible!

2. **Use cherry-picking** to copy commits between branches without rewriting history - [here's how](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/managing-commits/cherry-picking-a-commit-in-github-desktop).

3. **If all else fails, use `--force-with-lease`** (not plain `--force`):
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/main
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```
   Then **leave a comment** explaining why you had to force-push, and be ready to re-address some feedback.

## After Approval
Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR (possibly squashing commits). 
Your contribution will be in the next WLED release - thank you! 🎉


## Coding Guidelines

### Source Code from an AI agent or bot
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's OK if you took help from an AI for writing your source code. 
>
> AI tools can be very helpful, but as the contributor, **you're responsible for the code**.

* Make sure you really understand the AI-generated code, don't just accept it because it "seems to work".
* Don't let the AI change existing code without double-checking by you as the contributor. Often, the result will not be complete. For example, previous source code comments may be lost.
* Remember that AI is still "Often-Wrong" ;-)
* If you don't feel confident using English, you can use AI for translating code comments and descriptions into English. AI bots are very good at understanding language. However, always check if the results are correct. The translation might still have wrong technical terms, or errors in some details.

#### Best Practice with AI

AI tools are powerful but "often wrong" - your judgment is essential! 😊

- ✅ **Understand the code** - As the person contributing to WLED, make sure you understand exactly what the AI-generated source code does
- ✅ **Review carefully** - AI can lose comments, introduce bugs, or make unnecessary changes
- ✅ **Be transparent** - Add comments `// AI: below section was generated by an AI` ... `// AI: end` around larger chunks
- ✅ **Use AI for translation** - AI is great for translating comments to English (but verify technical terms!)

### Code style

Don't stress too much about style! When in doubt, just match the style in the files you're editing. 😊

Our review bot (coderabbit) has learned lots of detailed guides and hints - it will suggest them automatically when you submit a PR for review.
If you are curious, these are the detailed guides:
* [C++ Coding](docs/cpp.instructions.md)
* [WebUi: HTML, JS, CSS](docs/web.instructions.md)

Below are the main rules used in the WLED repository:

#### Indentation

We use tabs for indentation in Web files (.html/.css/.js) and spaces (2 per indentation level) for all other files.  
You are all set if you have enabled `Editor: Detect Indentation` in VS Code.

#### Blocks

Whether the opening bracket of e.g. an `if` block is in the same line as the condition or in a separate line is up to your discretion. If there is only one statement, leaving out block brackets is acceptable.

Good:  
```cpp
if (a == b) {
  doStuff(a);
}
```

```cpp
if (a == b) doStuff(a);
```

Also acceptable (though the first style is usually easier to read):
```cpp
if (a == b)
{
  doStuff(a);
}
```


There should always be a space between a keyword and its condition and between the condition and brace.  
Within the condition, no space should be between the parenthesis and variables.  
Spaces between variables and operators are up to the authors discretion.
There should be no space between function names and their argument parenthesis.

Good:  
```cpp
if (a == b) {
  doStuff(a);
}
```

Not good:  
```cpp
if( a==b ){
  doStuff ( a);
}
```

#### Comments

Comments should have a space between the delimiting characters (e.g. `//`) and the comment text.
We're gradually adopting this style - don't worry if you see older code without spaces!

Good:  
```cpp
// This is a short inline comment.

/* 
 * This is a longer comment
 * wrapping over multiple lines,
 * used in WLED for file headers and function explanations
 */
```
```css
/* This is a CSS inline comment */
```
```html
<!-- This is an HTML comment -->
```

There is no hard character limit for a comment within a line,
though as a rule of thumb consider wrapping after 120 characters.
Inline comments are OK if they describe that line only and are not exceedingly wide.
