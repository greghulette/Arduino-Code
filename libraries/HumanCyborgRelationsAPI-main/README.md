# Human Cyborg Relations C++ API
C++ based API for interfacing with Michael Perl's [Human Cyborg Relations](https://humancyborgrelations.com/r2d2/) Teensy Based Vocalizers

## Overview

[Human Cyborg Relations](https://humancyborgrelations.com/r2d2/), created by Michael Perl, has set a new standard for Droid Vocalization through a fully functional AI, powered by advanced research into the speech patterns and emotional logic of R2-D2.

Each vocalization is unique. A sophisticated algorithm assembles R2’s speech "phoneme" by "phoneme." Billions upon billions of rules dictate how each sound should be selected, processed, timed, and sequenced to achieve emotional and canonical accuracy.

The [Human Cyborg Relations R2 Vocalizer](https://humancyborgrelations.com/r2d2/) has been ported to the Teensy 4.1 Hardware for stand-alone integration into custom droids build for the Astromech community usage. The WIKI and CODE here relates to the C++ Library created for Arduino/Teensy/ESP projects to allow people to interface their boards with the HCR R2 Vocalizer programmed Teensy 4.1 + Audio Shield.

Please when using this library, we encourage everyone to make a small donation directly to and support [Force for Change](https://www.starwars.com/force-for-change) and [FIRST®](https://www.firstinspires.org/)
